ProjectXðŸŒŠ is a technical analysis centric app that can backtest popular trading strategies such as the Long-Short trading strategy designed for the personal trader. 
I wrote ProjectX to collate my projects that I have built in github over the years back testing strategies, risk pricing C++ into a concise platform deliverable that showcases a decade plus of industry expertise in risk management and trading & execution systems.

We explore long-short strategy by using trend based mean reversion stock indicators; in this case the moving average stock indicator; a lagging indicator that can identify trends and reversals. 
Finding similar well-known trading strategies from public sources is easily accessible, the key for a profitable strategy is the optimization methods that have been carried out and this app provides the toolkit to support this endeavour.

The core compute engine is running on cloud-native ASP.NET Core with a Desktop UI (WPF) and the Web Portal front end (React). The compute engine is deployable cross platform (tested on Win/MacOs/Linux) tested with vc++ g++ .net mono pricers on standaloned servers.  Production deployed ASP.NET Core HostedService to Azure container app compute farm building out a grid of milliseconds latency native c++ linux and .net pricers enabling futue potential elastic computation growth. Regular CI/CD github actions azure deveops pipeline ensures continous delivery and HA.

Successful trading strategy development requires backtesting on historical real price data, 
ProjectX provides the following features to assist the optimization process:
* ability to design trading strategies for demo trade purposes and backtest said strategies by running a simulation on financial stocks like GOOGL, AAPL.
* captures live market data from reliable third party data sources such as FMP, Quandl

The supporting components relates to providing pricers to help explore advantagous and potential arbitrage opportunities, fine-tune pricing models, and understand market sentiment.
ProjectX provides the following highly customizable and optimizable toolkit
* ProjectX implements pricing models for FX products based on spreaded commisions, Options Pricing.
* Vanilla Options Black Scholes Pricer (C#)
