ProjectXðŸŒŠ is a technical analysis centric app that can backtest popular trading strategies such as the Long-Short trading strategy designed for the personal trader. 
I wrote ProjectX to collate my projects that I have built in github over the years option risk pricing C++, back testing strategies into a concise platform deliverable that showcases a decade plus of industry expertise in risk management and trading & execution systems.

We explore long-short strategy by using trend based mean reversion stock indicators; in this case the moving average stock indicator; a lagging indicator that can identify trends and reversals. 
Finding similar well-known trading strategies from public sources is easily accessible, the key for a profitable strategy is the optimization methods that have been carried out and this app provides the toolkit to support this endeavour.

The core compute engine is running on cloud-compatabile ASP.NETCore with a Desktop UI (WPF) and a Web Portal front end (React).

Successful trading strategy development requires backtesting on historical real price data, 
ProjectX provides the following features to assist the optimization process:
* ability to design trading strategies for demo trade purposes and backtest said strategies by running a simulation on financial stocks like GOOGL, AAPL.
* captures live market data from reliable third party data sources such as FMP, Quandl
